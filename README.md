Welcome!

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper:
“Machine Learning Framework for Speech Intelligibility Prediction using Binaural Room Impulse Responses” (Alfian et al., 2026)

It provides the following resources:
1) Supplementary documents containing additional tables, figures, and details of the dataset acquisition process.
2) BRIR dataset, consisting of 370 BRIRs High Intelligibility Class, 370 BRIRs Low Intelligibility Class, and 6 Binaural Recordings for calibration.
3) Python source code for developing and evaluating the machine learning model.

All materials in this repository are open-source.
If you use any of these resources, please cite the paper (Alfian et al., 2026).

Thank you, and enjoy exploring the dataset and code!
